				<p>
					The Software Development Life Cycle or sometimes called the Systems Development Life Cycle is a
					structured method of developing complex software and system designs. The software development life
					cycle refers to particular deliverables and describes a general documentation guideline.

				<p>
					Since the software development life cycle was implemented in the 1960's as the SDM (Software Development
					method) many methodologies have been developed that are successors to the original SDLC design pattern.
					While many such methodologies exist today, the most popular are subsets that use the original Software
					Development Life Cycle documentation artifacts and have commercial tooling support.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tooling support in terms of software development can be found by many independent software vendors that
					provide common off the shelf packages. Tooling support can be as simple as a word processor for document
					artifact deliverables or as complex as cloud based build services for distributed software development
					teams.
				</p>

				<p>
					The most popular methodologies used in today's feature packed software tools and integrated development
					environments are Scrum, Agile or Agile Unified Process (AUP), Rational Unified Process (RUP) Extreme
					Programming (XP) and Rapid Application Development (RAD). Many of these methodologies have common
					development stages and all are used for requirements analysis, concept, prototyping, development, testing,
					deployment and support in varying forms.
