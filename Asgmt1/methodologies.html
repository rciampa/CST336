						The Waterfall methodology is a sequential process that utilizes a series of stages in the process
						of software and systems development. In each stage the SDLC is adhered to by document artifacts
						and deliverables within each stage. The Waterfall method is a first generation methodology used
						in the Software Development Life Cycle.

					<p>
						The Waterfall methodology has the following stages:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Requirements Analysis
							</li>
							<li>
								Analysis of business processes
							</li>
							<li>
								Design and Architecture
							</li>
							<li>
								Coding, Development and Integration
							</li>
							<li>
								Testing and Debugging
							</li>
							<li>
								Operational Deployment, Installation, Migration and Maintenance

					<p>
						The Rapid Application Development methodology, not to be confused with RAD tools is predecessor
						to the majority of the latest software development methodologies. It breaks from the traditional
						Waterfall method in an attempt to reduce and mitigate developmental risk factors.
					</p>
					<p>
						The approach to users requirements and testing is one of the major differences in Rapid Application
						development. In this methodology users are better able to see business logic and usability issues
						in the development process. The core difference being that RAD provides a prototype which users are
						able to test and provide feedback on. These are major changes from the Waterfall method which simply
						has users sign off on requirements and test the software product in beta just prior to the production
						release.

						Scrum is an iterative and incremental software development process. In this method the entire development
						team works through each stage of the process and iteration or sprint. The largest difference that we
						see in the Scrum method compared to the original SDM and early methods like Waterfall is that each
						phase of the process is iterative and incremental.
					</p>

					<p>
						Since Scrum is a latest generation methodology, there exist sophisticated tooling support and converged
						toolsets. The requirements process is ongoing in each sprint and prototypes of software are tested in
						each incremental release. As you can see from figure four above the iteration can be relatively short, in
						some cases only twenty four hours long. This is where the word "sprint" comes from.
					</p>
					<p>
						Scrum is logically oriented in the concept of how parts of the SDLC fit into a sprint. In Scrum
						we use the product backlog to continuously add requirements, features and bug fixes. The backlog is
						then used to generate Work Breakdown Structure within each sprint. Once the a sprint backlog has
						been generated, the sprint is scheduled and work begins.

					<p>
						Agile software project management is considered the most flexible of the methodologies. While
						Scrum is also an agile process the core difference in Agile software development is the evolution
						of a feature-set and software product while in development.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are many overlapping aspects of Scrum and Agile methods beside the fact that they are both
						agile methods. The Agile method is known for resource autonomy. This is the ultimate in distributed
						development. Resources like project managers, systems analysts, developers and testers are usually
						geographically dispersed.
					</p>
					<p>
						In a pure Agile development method, project managers may fly from a home office to a site for milestone updates.
						You can have a group of developers that are completely autonomous and as long as they have an internet
						connection they are able to contribute to the Agile process. The emphasis in Agile is that dispersed
						teams and individual experiences outside a common office help evolve a project and software product. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the Agile method is almost always a distributed team effort Agile requires some of the most
						sophisticated converged toolsets in the industry. Document artifacts in the SDLC specification are
						deeply integrated into the development and project management toolset.
